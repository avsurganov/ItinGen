# Itinerary Algorithm

## Testing

Test files are contained in the tests directory

*Note: I am assuming we are going to have different tests in different
files for now, such as time, events, distance, overall, etc. Ultimately
these tests should be called from a master function that runs alll of them.
Will finalize how this works before 11/21*
